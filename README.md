#Storage saving unit

This is a college project made to mimick the allocation of memory from a minimal operating system. It includes four main operations that are required for any system to work properly: adding data, finding it, deleting it and keeping it organised (by means of defragmentation). Code is entirely written in asm x86.

This README is a work in progress (I will most likely update it with explanations for the code)

*Note: the folder **tests** contains examples of inputs used to verify the validity of the code.*
